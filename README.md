# Crunchyroll Downloader

Downloads anime from Crunchyroll and outputs them in a MKV file.

You won't be banned or anything, I downloaded all Kaguya-Sama seasons to test during 30 mins and everything went fine

## Features

- Supports choosing the audio and subtitles language
- Supports choosing the audio and video quality
- Decrypts Widevine DRM (requires: a `.wvd` file or `client_id.bin` and `private_key.pem` files)
- Adds metadata (like episode name) to the MKV container
- Parallel segment downloads (10 workers) for faster downloads
- Retry with backoff on connection errors
- Batch download from a list of URLs

## Requirements

- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages)
- To download Premium-only content, a Crunchyroll Premium account. No, this can't be bypassed and a free trial should be enough
- Either a `.wvd` file, or a `client_id.bin` and `private_key.pem`

### What is a `.wvd` file and do I really need one?

Yes, Crunchyroll uses DRM-only content. This file is used to get a Widevine license, which gives the keys to decrypt the media.

If you don't have a rooted Android device or are just lazy, search "ready to use cdms" and you'll find plenty of websites providing those files.
